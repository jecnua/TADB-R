TADB-R
======

TADB-R is an _always on beta_ chess IA. It has been written to work with the
xboard/winboard application. This project is in its third life iteration and it
will hopefully continue do die and reborn. Rigth now it is still not usable
since a *IfYouNotFixMeItWillAlwaysCrash* bug stil needs to be fixed. But still I
 have some emotional attachment to it. It will work and play enough to lose...
 one day.

- Prerequisites    
You have to install _xboard_ on linux or _winboard_ on windows to use TADB-R 
chess IA.

- Usage: Linux    
To play against TADB-R, just lunch xboard like this:    
		$ xboard -fcp 'java -jar TADBR.jar'    
To see him play (and crash) against the pc use:    
		$ xboard -mm -fcp "/usr/games/fairymax" -scp "java -jar 
		TADBR.jar"

- Usage: Windows    
It has been tested on Windows with success.
